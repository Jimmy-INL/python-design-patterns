    "1. `Virtual Proxy`: It acts as a placeholder for objects that are difficult to instantiate. for ex. when you want to \n",

    "    clicks on it, it will be loaded. \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. `Remote proxy`: It provides local representation of a real object that resides on a remote server or different \n",
    "    address  space. ex. when we build a monitoring system for a application that has multiple web servers, DB servers, \n",
    "    caching servers etc. If we want to monitor the CPU and disk utilization of these servers, we need to have an object \n",
    "    that is available in the context of where the monitoring application runs but can perform remote commands to get \n",
    "    the actual parameter values.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. `Protective proxy`: This proxy controls access to the sensitive matter object of Real subject. ex. these days, web \n",
    "    applications have mutiple services that work together to provide functionality. Authentication service acts as a \n",
    "    protective proxy server that is responsible for authentication and authorization. \n",
    "    \n",
    "4. `Smart proxy`: Smart proxies interpose additional actions when an object is accessed. ex. consider when there's a\n",
    "    core component in the system taht stores states in a centralized location. Such component is called by different \n",
    "    services  to complete their tasks and there can be a problem of shared resources. Smart proxy is a built in which\n",
